# Garry

Garry is a discord bot, that has a few commands(WIP)

## How To
1. first `git clone https://github.com/ZakGhost354313/Garry.git`
2. then `cd Garry`
3. run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. finally `python3 Garry.py`

## CMDs
- `/lol` - sends a randomly meme from the `memes.txt`(not provided)
- `/ping` - sends a pong back
- `/a` - sends a python hexcode to "ascii" character message
- `99!` - is a brooklyne 99 joke thing i got it from a tutorial
- `/idk` - a joke from a friend
- `/github` - sends the link to the github
- `/end` or `/exit` - will preforme the python-builtin script `exit(0)`
- `/t` - a test command, if preformed properly it can either be a joke, or a simple test of paramaters
- `/w @user message` - will @ a user with the provide message
- `/lol-test` - a test command for the memegen.lol script
- `/beemovie` - will send the entire bee movie script line by line... idk dude it can only be stopped with `/exit`, `/end`, or by manueling stopping the bot 


## Notes
- the memes.txt file for the `/lol` command is simply a text file with a link to an image or video file of a meme
